<h1 align="center"> Linguagem API </h1>

Building a REST API to expose our own content, using professional tools like Spring Framework, Maven, and a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
Finally deploy the application on Heroku. 

This API will show some of the most popular languages, their logo and a fictitious ranking.
The purpose of creating this API would be to use it in another program in which it extracts the JSON and creates stickers to send by Whatsapp.

You can acess the application in the link below:
